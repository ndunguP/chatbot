In this code, we will use chatterbot module and import chatbot and then train them by using chatterbot.trainers module  and pass chatbot as an argument to it where we train them by saying them some words in list format by using train method. Now, by using while loop we make the chatbot to response again and again such that it can response every question of the user after completion of first question.
